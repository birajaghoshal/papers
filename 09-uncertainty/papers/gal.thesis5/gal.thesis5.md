  - **Intro Paragraph:** In previous chapters we linked stochastic regularisation techniques (SRTs) to approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks (NNs), and studied the resulting model uncertainty for popular SRTs such as dropout. We have yet to give any real-world applications stemming from this link though, leaving it somewhat in the realms of "theoretical work". But a theory is worth very little if we can’t use it to obtain new tools, or shed light on existing ones. In this chapter we will survey recent literature making use of the tools developed in the previous chapters in fields ranging from language processing to computer vision to biomedical domains. This is followed by more use cases I have worked on recently with the help of others. We will see how model uncertainty can be used to choose what data to learn from (joint work with Riashat Islam as part of his Master’s project). Switching to applications in deep reinforcement learning, we will see how model uncertainty can help exploration. This is then followed by the development of a data efficient framework in deep reinforcement learning (joint work with Rowan McAllister and Carl Rasmussen). A study of the implications of this work on our understanding of existing tools will be given in the next chapter.
